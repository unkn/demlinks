We have a Node identified by a string "A". Case sensitive.
This string will always point to that same node, unless node is recreated.
This Node has two lists. A list of parents and a list of children.

These lists contain NodeReference elements.
A NR is a reference that points to a Node.
A NR may point to only one node. A NR cannot point to another NR.
NRs exist only in lists. Any NR is unique.
Two different NRs may point to the same Node and be in the same list.
That's how duplicate of nodes are supported.
A NR should know in which list it is, and the list must know what 
type of list it is(child/parent) and who's the Node that contains this list.
In effect this means the NR would know what Node contains it and if it's 
in a parent or child list within that node.

A NR has a prev and a next within itself, to know which NR is next and 
which is prev within the list that it exists.
A NR exists only in one list. It cannot exist in two or more. That's for nodes.

A Node can point to another Node via a NR, how? A Node will add a new NR into it's
children list, and this NR will point to this other Node.

The point for NR is that they need to be identified in order to insert/delete certain 
nodes from the list.

NR can exist within thinkdraft001 as:
A->RND1->B
A->RND2->C
A->RND3->B
NodeRefs->RND1
NodeRefs->RND2
NodeRefs->RND3
that's in case dups exist, if dups don't exist there's no need for RND elements(which act as NRs)

I'm not exactly sure which version is better, the NR or the RND version, although I was counting on the RND version until now,
but as you can see the RND version has the NRs in an indirect and subtle way, but the NRs are still there. It seems that for the sake of
clarity and accessibility the NR version should exist. Instead the RND version seems like a speed optimization from NR.
