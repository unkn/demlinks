So what we have so far:

There is such a thing called node which is identified by both a string called ID and by a Node object.
For the same node, there can be only one Node object that identifies it. There is a one to one relationship between the node and its identifiers.
For example: a node identified with the String ID "test" will have a Node object associated with that ID such that, if you know the ID you can get
the Node object, and if you know the Node object you can get the String ID.
	ID <-> Node

So it's like a map between the string ID and the Node object.

Now, this Node object can point to other Node objects.
Also this Node object can be pointed by other Node objects.

--------------Disregard:
Due to limitations in some databases the following may or may not be applied:
The Node can only exist if it is either pointed or points to at least one other Node.
In other words, Nodes can only exist in tuples. There are no disconnected nodes.
(A node can exist if it points to no other nodes but it is pointed to by at least one other node.)

Basicly a Node should not be isolated. But if a Node can point to itself then it's isolated anyway.
Also two nodes that only point to eachother (basicly it's enought that one points to the other) are isolated from the rest.
So a lonely disconnected Node shouldn't be a problem. 
--------------end disregard.

ok so forget the above, we will allow Nodes with no children and no parents. 
-------mutual links
To be consistent, a Node A that has a node B in its children list ( A.children.has(B) ) 
will imply that node B has node A in its parents list ( B.parents.has(A) )
We can say that node A points to node B, if the above are true.
The above is noted: A->B.
However note that if B points to A that's an entirely different new link, whereas B.children.has(A) and A.parents.has(B)
Noted: B->A

also a note like A<-B is saying that B.parents.has(A) but also implies the obvious that A.children.has(B)

X.children.has(Y) means that Y is a child of X. Or that X has a list of children that it points to and Y is in that list.

---------
the lists cannot contain duplicate Nodes.
A->B
A->C
A->B (again) is not allowed (for the simple reason that just by identifying nodes via a String ID, it's impossible 
to tell which B from A's children are we talking about: the first B or the last B; ie. we cannot pinpoint that specific B from A by using only 
Node IDs)

-------
the order of the Nodes in the lists matters
ie. 
A->B
A->C
A->D

the order is B,C,D and that order matters.

When linking two nodes typically they are appended to the lists. ie. link(A,E) will add A->E after A->D and same for E , A will be appended A<-E

------------
To handle DUPs at a higher level we would insert Nodes with random but unique IDs between the parent and the Nodes in the list like this:
if we want:
A->B
A->C
A->B
we do:
A->RND1->B
A->RND2->C
A->RND3->B
and RND1 thru 3 they don't point to anything else, but they can be pointed by more than just A
Now if you want to pinpoint last B you just use RND3 as a node ID and you're there...
----------------

In java the expectations were like:
if you get the Node object you can link to new nodes using only that object such as
Node a = env.getNode("a");//uses the environment instance to get the Node mapped to the ID "a" (assuming it exists, else returns null)
a.linkTo("newNode"); // now node "a" -> "newNode"
print( a.getID() ); //will show the ID of the Node object a

also: a.linkTo(b); //where b is another Node

also, using a listIterator on the ie. children list of "a"
ListIterator litr = a.get(List.CHILDREN).listIterator();
litr.insert("new2", Location.BEFORE, "newNode"); //or stuff like that
